# CGThresholds
![PluginShot](https://i.imgur.com/lcfxil9.png)

A plugin for [Elite Dangerous Market Connector](https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector) that transmits anonymous data to [CGThresholdCalculator](https://sites.google.com/site/cgtthreshcalc/home) to calculate the Boundary for the Reward Tiers, so you can know if you just need to make 'One more run' to get those extra Creds!
